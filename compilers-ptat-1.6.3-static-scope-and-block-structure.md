# Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools

For the full repository with samples have a look at [GitHub](https://github.com/lordasgart/Compilers_Principles-Techniques-and-Tools).

## 1.6.3 Static Scope and Block Structure

Working on **Chapter 1.6.8 Exercies for Section 1.6** I decided to try the given examples in C# and C++, because I already thought while reading this chapter, that the given sample of `Fig. 1.13(a)` would not be compilable with the C# compiler.

Indeed the C# compiler throws [Compiler Error CS0136](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0136) when trying to compile any code in the given block structure.

TODO: Insert screenshots!

See [Original.cs](https://github.com/lordasgart/Compilers_Principles-Techniques-and-Tools/blob/main/Fig113a/Original.cs) for this try.
